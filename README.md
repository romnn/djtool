#### Development roadmap

- implement a async webserver that runs in the background
- add tauri

#### Big issues to address

- Connect with the spotify API to read out the playlists
- Query youtube search results
- add tauri frontend and see if it can use WebAudio to play back the MP3's
- get the youtube thumbails and song duration
- Maybe: implement the JS parser to decipher youtube stream urls
- Maybe: implement shazam like fingerprinting
- build and upload release executables for linux and macos first
